[![Read in Russian](https://img.shields.io/badge/Read-in_Russian-green)](README.ru.md)

This code contains a simple implementation of a **Telegram** bot that provides weather information for a city. The main tool used was **OWM**. To use this code, you need to find the **@BotFather** bot in **Telegram** itself and create your own *API key* for further work with the code. The service that provides the *API key* for accessing weather data is **[OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)**.
